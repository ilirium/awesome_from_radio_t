https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer

PyOxidizer is a utility for producing binaries that embed Python.
The over-arching goal of PyOxidizer is to make complex packaging and
distribution problems simple so application maintainers can focus on
building applications instead of toiling with build systems and
packaging tools.

https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

jq is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and
map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed,
awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

jq is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime dependencies.
You can download a single binary, scp it to a far away machine of
the same type, and expect it to work.

jq can mangle the data format that you have into the one that you
want with very little effort, and the program to do so is often
shorter and simpler than you'd expect.

## Poetry

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

## Plumbum

https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/

Ever wished the compactness of shell scripts be put into a real programming language?
Say hello to Plumbum Shell Combinators. Plumbum (Latin for lead, which was used to create pipes back in the day)
is a small yet feature-rich library for shell script-like programs in Python. The motto of the library is
“Never write shell scripts again”, and thus it attempts to mimic the shell syntax (shell combinators)
where it makes sense, while keeping it all Pythonic and cross-platform.

Apart from shell-like syntax and handy shortcuts, the library provides local and remote command execution (over SSH),
local and remote file-system paths, easy working-directory and environment manipulation, quick access to ANSI colors,
and a programmatic Command-Line Interface (CLI) application toolkit. Now let’s see some code!

## PyOxidizer

Part: 00:47:05, "Как в Яндексе развивался Python"

https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer

PyOxidizer is a utility for producing binaries that embed Python.
The over-arching goal of PyOxidizer is to make complex packaging and
distribution problems simple so application maintainers can focus on
building applications instead of toiling with build systems and
packaging tools.# Radio-T #715, 2020-08-15
